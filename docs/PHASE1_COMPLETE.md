2. **Enhanced Tool Definitions**
   - Refactored Mineflayer tools to use proper function signatures
   - All tools return structured dictionaries with status/result
   - Added input validation and error handling
   - Created comprehensive tool documentation

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Created `AgentConfig` using Pydantic-Settings

   - Proper instruction engineering with state injection
   - Output key usage for structured responses

2. **Workflow Agents**
   - SequentialAgent: `GatherAndBuild` - ordered task execution
   - ParallelAgent: `MultiGatherer` - concurrent resource collection
   - LoopAgent: `RetryMovement` - iterative task with retry logic
   - All patterns implemented with proper ADK structure

3. **Tool Patterns**
   - Implemented tool retry logic in bridge layer
   - Added timeout handling (configurable via config)
   - Created tool composition examples
   - Built failure recovery mechanisms

### Section 1.3: Testing and Validation ✅

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Created comprehensive test suite for ADK components
   - Mocked ADK Runner to avoid API calls in tests
   - Validated state management and tool execution
   - Tested error handling paths

2. **Integration Testing**
   - New `test_adk_integration.py` with end-to-end tests
   - Verified agent initialization and command processing
   - Tested workflow agent creation
   - Validated tool integration with ADK

3. **Performance Baseline**
   - Established <500ms command latency requirement
   - Created performance measurement tests
   - Profiled memory usage patterns
   - Set targets for future optimization

## Key Achievements

### 1. Real ADK Integration
```python
# Before (Mock)
return f"Mock response for: {command}"

# After (Real ADK)
async for event in self.runner.run_async(
    user_id="minecraft_player",
    session_id=self.session.id,
    new_message=user_content
):
    if event.is_final_response():
        final_response = extract_response(event)
```

### 2. Proper Tool Implementation
```python
# ADK-compatible tool with proper error handling
async def move_to(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        await _bridge_manager.move_to(x, y, z)
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "position": {"x": x, "y": y, "z": z}
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "error", "error": str(e)}
```

### 3. Configuration Excellence
```python
# Flexible configuration with multiple credential sources
config = AgentConfig(
    google_ai_api_key="from-env-or-config",
    default_model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    agent_temperature=0.2,
    command_timeout_ms=10000
)
```

### 4. Test Coverage
- Created 7 new ADK-specific integration tests
- Maintained existing test suite compatibility
- Added performance baseline tests
- Comprehensive error scenario coverage

## Technical Improvements

1. **Code Quality**
   - Fixed all linting issues with ruff
   - Consistent code formatting
   - Removed trailing whitespace and blank lines
   - Proper exception handling (no bare except)

2. **Architecture**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Modular tool system
   - Flexible configuration management
   - Event-driven architecture maintained

3. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive docstrings
   - Created `.env.example` for easy setup
   - Updated README with ADK patterns
   - Clear setup instructions

## Configuration Guide

### Setting Up Google ADK
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   MINECRAFT_AGENT_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Or use environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

### Running the System
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Start Minecraft server on localhost:25565

# Run interactive agent
python scripts/run_agent.py agent --interactive

# Run capability demo
python scripts/run_agent.py agent --demo
```
