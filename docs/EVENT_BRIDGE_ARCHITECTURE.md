# Event Bridge Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Event Bridge system provides a comprehensive, production-ready communication layer between Mineflayer (JavaScript) and Google ADK (Python) agents. It transforms simple spawn detection into a full-featured event-driven architecture supporting 20+ event types, advanced filtering, state synchronization, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Architecture Components

## Event Flow Architecture

```
JavaScript (Mineflayer)           Python (ADK)
         |                             |
    [Bot Events] ─────┐                |
         |            │                |
    [EventEmitter] ─── [Event Bridge] ─┴─ [ADK Agent]
         |            │                |
    [WebSocket] ──────┘                |
                      │                |
                 [Monitoring] ─────────┘
```

### Detailed Event Flow

1. **Event Generation**: Minecraft bot generates events (spawn, chat, position, etc.)
2. **Event Emission**: MinecraftEventEmitter creates standardized payloads
3. **Bridge Reception**: Event bridge receives events via WebSocket
4. **Validation**: Dual validation (common + event-specific schemas)
5. **Filtering**: Event filters determine processing eligibility
6. **Queue Management**: Priority queue handles event ordering and batching
7. **ADK Processing**: ADK adapter converts events to EventActions
8. **State Updates**: State synchronizer updates ADK session state
9. **Monitoring**: Metrics, tracing, and profiling capture performance data

## Event Types and Schemas

### Core Event Categories

#### Player Events
- `minecraft:spawn` - Bot spawn in world
- `minecraft:chat` - Chat messages
- `minecraft:death` - Player death
- `minecraft:health` - Health/food changes
- `minecraft:experience` - XP changes

#### World Interaction
- `minecraft:position` - Position updates
- `minecraft:block` - Block interactions
- `minecraft:inventory` - Inventory changes
- `minecraft:equipment` - Equipment changes

#### Environment Events
- `minecraft:time` - Time changes
- `minecraft:weather` - Weather updates
- `minecraft:entity` - Entity interactions
- `minecraft:sound` - Sound events

#### System Events

- `minecraft:error` - Error conditions
- `minecraft:goal` - Goal/task updates
- `minecraft:pathfinding` - Navigation events

### Payload Schema Structure

All events follow a common base schema:
```python
{
    "eventType": str,      # Event type identifier
    "timestamp": float,    # Unix timestamp
    "source": str,         # Event source (bot ID)
    "eventId": str,        # Unique event identifier
    "data": dict          # Event-specific payload
}
```

Event-specific schemas extend this base with validated data structures using Pydantic models.

### Monitoring Integration

```python
from src.bridge.event_bridge import get_metrics_collector, get_tracer

# Access metrics
metrics = get_metrics_collector()
system_stats = metrics.get_system_metrics()

# Access tracing
tracer = get_tracer()
trace_stats = tracer.get_trace_statistics()
```
