# Event-Driven Bridge Implementation Plan for Minecraft ADK Integration

## Project Overview

This plan details the implementation of a comprehensive event-driven communication bridge between Mineflayer (JavaScript) and Google ADK (Python). The architecture establishes a scalable pattern for bidirectional event flow, enabling ADK agents to respond to Minecraft world events while maintaining proper state management.

**Core Objective:** Transform the current single-event spawn detection fix into a complete event bridge architecture that aligns with Google ADK's event-driven patterns and state management principles.

## Phase 1: Event Bridge Foundation

### Goal
Establish the core event bridge infrastructure with proper naming conventions, extensible patterns, and ADK compliance.

### Section 1.1: Refactor Current Implementation

#### 1.1.1 Create Event Bridge Module Structure
**Goal:** Organize event handling into a maintainable module structure

- Create `src/bridge/event_bridge/` directory structure
- Move event-related code from `bridge_manager.py` into dedicated modules
- Establish clear separation between event emission (JS) and consumption (Python)

#### 1.1.2 Rename and Generalize Event Patterns
**Goal:** Replace "option2" terminology with meaningful names

- Rename `python_ready` event to `minecraft:spawn` following namespace convention
- Update all references in `bot.js` and `bridge_manager.py`
- Create event naming convention documentation

#### 1.1.3 Create Event Registry
**Goal:** Centralize event definitions and metadata

```python
# Pseudocode for event registry structure
EVENT_REGISTRY = {
    "minecraft:spawn": {
        "description": "Bot successfully spawned in world",
        "payload_schema": {
            "spawned": bool,
            "position": dict,
            "time": int
        },
        "adk_state_mapping": {
            "minecraft.spawned": "spawned",
            "minecraft.position": "position",
            "minecraft.spawn_time": "time"
        }
    }
}
```

### Section 1.2: JavaScript Event Emitter Enhancement

#### 1.2.1 Create Minecraft Event Emitter Class
**Goal:** Centralize all Minecraft-to-Python event emissions

- Create `src/minecraft/MinecraftEventEmitter.js`
- Extend or wrap the bot's EventEmitter functionality
- Implement consistent event payload structure

#### 1.2.2 Implement Event Emission Helper
**Goal:** Standardize event emission with metadata

```javascript
// Pseudocode for emission helper
emitToPython(eventName, data) {
    const payload = {
        event: `minecraft:${eventName}`,
        data: data,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        botId: this.bot.username
    };
    this.bot.emit(payload.event, payload);
}
```

#### 1.2.3 Add Event Lifecycle Logging
**Goal:** Enable debugging and monitoring of event flow

- Log all emitted events with structured logging
- Include event name, payload size, and timing information
- Create debug mode for verbose event tracking

### Section 1.3: Python Event Handler Architecture

#### 1.3.1 Create ADK Event Adapter
**Goal:** Bridge Minecraft events to ADK EventActions

- Create `src/bridge/event_bridge/adk_adapter.py`
- Implement automatic conversion from Minecraft events to EventActions
- Handle state_delta generation based on event registry

#### 1.3.2 Implement Event Handler Decorator
**Goal:** Simplify event handler registration

```python
# Pseudocode for decorator pattern
@minecraft_event("minecraft:spawn")
async def handle_spawn(event_data: dict) -> EventActions:
    return EventActions(
        state_delta={
            "minecraft.spawned": True,
            "minecraft.position": event_data["position"]
        }
    )
```

#### 1.3.3 Create Event Queue with Priority
**Goal:** Handle high-frequency events efficiently

- Implement priority queue for event processing
- Critical events (spawn, death) get high priority
- Bulk events (position updates) can be batched
